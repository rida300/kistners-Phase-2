### Assignment Description
For this assignment, imagine you are working for a web development studio.  Your company has been approached about crafting a new website for the local business, Kistner's Flowers.  Their [current website](https://www.kistnersflowers.com/) is not meeting their needs, and they would like to explore more options.  Your boss wants you to create a mockup that embraces the customer's primary concerns:
* Clearly conveys the identity of Kistner’s flowers through branding and design elements
* Prominently displays a range of floral arrangements Kistner’s Flowers can produce, along with their name and price
* Emphasizes Kistner’s Flowers' ability to craft arrangements for special occasions, with emphasis on weddings and funerals
* Makes available to customers the policies of the store and addresses potential customer concerns or questions

In addition to the customer's requirements, your boss has added some technology-centric ones as well:

* The web server needs to be written in Node using only core libraries
* Any static files you serve should be placed in the __public__ directory.
* The site design needs to be ready to swap out floral arrangements dynamically.  You have been provided with a module `src/recipes.js` with a single mock function `featured()`.  This function takes a count of arrangements as its parameter and returns an array of JavaScript objects representing a floral recipe that size.  You should use this function to obtain the data for the arrangements displayed on the front page. Images referenced by the objects are found in the __public/images__ directory.

Beyond these core criteria, the details of the site are in your hands.

### Branding Information
The Kistner's Flowers colors are:
* `#83052B` burgandy
* `#C9B66F` gold
* `#F2EBD0` cream

The detail font is __Vivaldi__.  You can select a different font for body text.

You may use the store and banner images in the __public/images__ folder:

![store.jpg](public/images/store.gif)

As well as any images you find on Kistner's social media pages:
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/KistnersFlowers1946/),
[Instagram](https://https://www.instagram.com/kistnersflowers/), and [Pintrest](https://www.pinterest.com/kistnersflowers/boards/)

### Additional Requirements
You may not use outside HTML JavaScript, or CSS libraries or templates on this project.  However you can look at existing web templates and libraries for inspiration and implementation details.  If you do, follow these guidelines:

1. Don't copy/paste their code.  Use your own structures, terms, and naming conventions.  Type things out a bit at a time and try them.  Essentially, _paraphrase_ their approach.  In doing so, you will gain a far better understanding of the techniques they are employing.
2. Cite the resources you used by adding a file named CITATIONS.txt or CITATIONS.md to this project, and providing urls to your sources.
